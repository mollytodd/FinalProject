LeadPulse is a comprehensive B2B application designed for efficient lead management, encompassing lead tracking, lead sources, and lead stages. The application boasts a full-stack architecture, with the backend crafted using Flask and Python for scripting.

Backend Features
The backend of LeadPulse includes robust data models for users, leads, lead types (stored in a separate table), and stages (also in a separate table). This architecture allows for the flexibility of associating multiple lead types with leads and connecting lead types with multiple users.

API Routes
LeadPulse provides a range of API routes to facilitate various functionalities:

Authentication: Includes routes for login, session checking, and logout.

Lead Management: (full CRUD) Enables operations such as retrieving, updating, adding, and deleting leads.
Lead Retrieval: Supports fetching leads by ID or lead type.
Frontend Technologies
The frontend of LeadPulse is built using React, chart.js, useContext for state management for the user, and Chakra UI for a sleek user interface.

User Dashboard
Upon logging in, users are greeted with a personalized dashboard that leverages Chart.js for dynamic data visualization. The dashboard offers a snapshot of crucial lead statistics, including total leads, won leads, lost leads, lead sources, and lead stages.

Real-time Notifications
LeadPulse keeps users informed with in-app notifications, notifying them promptly when a new lead is added. These notifications are conveniently displayed on the left sidebar.

Interactive Pie Charts
Users can interact with the pie charts on the dashboard, clicking on specific segments to navigate directly to corresponding leads. For example, clicking on 'Instagram' redirects the user to a lead page displaying only Instagram-related leads.

Lead Management
Lead addition is streamlined, allowing users to instantly add new leads to the comprehensive leads list. The application facilitates easy filtering and data export directly from the lead page.
